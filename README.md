# MINI-PROJECT

In this work, we refer to the novel cryptographic framework that integrates 
BFV-Brakerski, Fan, and Vercauteren, as well as CKKS Cheon-Kim-KimSong homomorphic encryption with adaptive privacy control, as FLIP (Federated Learning Implementation with Privacy). FLIP incorporates a privacy practitioner within the model framework to dynamically adjust the encryption parameters, optimizing security and performance in proportion to system demands. The framework achieves secure model aggregation at a total computation cost that enables scalable FL to be deployed in large-scale installations with minimal cost. Our evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets under adversarial data poisoning and model inversion attack scenarios shows that FLIP achieves 99.23% accuracy on MNIST and 66.35% on CIFAR-10, with lowered leakage privacy of ε = 6 and 8, respectively, outperforming the protected FL leak lower bound results. FLIP reduces the computational burden, further enabling unrestricted device scaling while maintaining resource constraints. The proposed strategy addresses the growing demand for privacy in medical, cybersecurity, and banking domains. Integrating blockchain, quantum hardened defenses, and advanced FL security will be explored in future work as a response to adaptive threat landscapes.
